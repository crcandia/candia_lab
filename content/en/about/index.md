<p style="text-align: center;"> The Computational Research in Social Science Laboratory (CRISS-LAB), founded in 2021, is a dynamic and interdisciplinary group of people that is committed to advancing applied research on human behavior. We focus on several key areas, including collective intelligence, collective memory, social media analysis, business and learning analytics, cooperative dynamics, and experimental game theory. At CRISS-LAB, we specialize in extracting valuable insights from observational data using advanced techniques such as causal inference, network science, and artificial intelligence to better understand individual and collective behavior across industry, academia, and government. Our overarching mission is to make a meaningful contribution to the advancement of both individuals and society as a whole by generating valuable information and practical solutions that can help to improve people's daily lives. We firmly believe that applying scientific discoveries to real-life situations can have a transformative impact. We are dedicated to ensure that our research has practical applications and tangible benefits for all.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"> A diverse group of enthusiastic graduate students, researchers, data scientists, and professors from different fields, such as physics, mathematics, sociology, economics, education, psychology, and engineering interact and collaborate at CRISS-LAB. Our operations are centered at the Data Science Institute of the Engineering School and the Center for Social Complexity at the Government School of the University of Desarrollo, located in Las Condes, Chile. </p>
