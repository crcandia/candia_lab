### Abstract:
<div>

**[ENG]**
<p align="justify"> We discuss two projects that quantify the consequences of our network location for our access to resources and rewards in science.  First, we investigate the dynamics of international science through the lens of national citation preferences, introducing a novel measure to characterize these processes and enabling a network analysis of global knowledge production.  Our results challenge the conventional core-periphery narrative of global science, instead uncovering several fragmented communities of knowledge production that are rapidly evolving and constraining the diffusion of ideas across international borders.  Second, we quantitatively model the complex dynamics of philanthropic grant making in the US.   Using publicly available tax records, we build the scientific funding network (925,335 grants between 69,000 institutions, totaling over $208 billion) to reveal that funders support geographically close recipients, and that grant-giving relationships become increasingly entrenched over time.  These principles combine with high levels of bipartite clustering to empower a predictive model of future funding relationships.  Together, these projects shed light on the barriers and opportunities for the equitable distribution of scientific resources and recognition, ultimately guiding policy recommendations to foster more inclusive and impactful scientific endeavors.</p>
