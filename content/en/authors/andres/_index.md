<p align="justify"> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qKqH1lcAAAAJ&hl=es&oi=ao">Andrés Abeliuk</a> is an Assistant Professor at the Department of Computer Science, University of Chile and a young researcher at Centro Nacional de Inteligencia Artificial (CENIA). His research focuses on analyzing the impact of algorithms in society and creating social computing systems to improve collective behavior through behavioral modeling, optimization, game theory, and online experiments. He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Melbourne, where he worked with Pascal Van Hentenryck and Gerardo Berbeglia. His thesis examined the negative effects of social influence and algorithmic curation of content on the Web and in cultural markets. After his Ph.D., he worked as a postdoctoral researcher at MIT Media Lab and investigated algorithm theory, computational complexity, and combinatorial optimization in social systems. He also worked as a research scientist at the USC Information Sciences Institute, where he collaborated on the development of algorithms and prototypes of socio-technological systems.</p>
