<p align="justify">  <a href="https://www.flaviolpp.com/">Flavio Pinheiro</a>  is an Invited Assistant Professor in Data Science at NOVA IMS (Universidade Nova de Lisboa - Information Management School). Prior to his current position, he worked as a postdoctoral associate at the Collective Learning group in the MIT Media Lab. His research involves a combination of theoretical (computer simulations and mathematical modelling of multi-agent systems) and empirical (data extraction and data analysis) approaches to comprehend the effect of the network structure of socio-economic systems on their functioning. Specifically, his research focuses on understanding how these networks affect the dynamical processes underlying the dissemination of information, diseases, opinions, and behaviors, and how these structures restrict agents' decision-making processes when they overlook a networked system and take actions over its elements. Flavio earned his BSc and MSc in Physics from the University of Lisbon (Portugal) and a Ph.D. in Physics from the University of Minho (Portugal). During his Ph.D., he worked closely with the GAIPS/INESC-ID (Lisbon) and was a Visiting Graduate Student at the MIT Media Lab Macro Connections/Collective Learning Group.</p>
